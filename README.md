# Financial Modelling of Pakistans GDP
##### Economic models are fundamental tools used in economics to explain, predict, and analyze various economic phenomena. These models are constructed based on a set of assumptions and mathematical equations that represent the behavior of individuals and groups within an economy. Economic models are essential to understand how the economy works and make informed decisions about economic policies.
##### Macroeconomic models focus on the behavior of the economy as a whole. These models analyze factors such as gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, unemployment, and interest rates. They also investigate the relationships between these factors and the impact of economic policies on the economy. Phillips’ Curve and Okun’s Law are one of the two most widely known models used in the economic modelling realm. Phillips Curve demonstrate a relationship between inflation and unemployment rates while Okun’s law signifies the relationship between growth rate of real GDP and change in unemployment rate. Thus, in this paper we will be modelling the two aforementioned models with real-world empirical data of Pakistan, a developing country in South Asia.
